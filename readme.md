Currently, the script places pieces in the position that results in the fewest gaps. This has resulted in fewer moves per game on average than the "first available position" strategy, but the playstyle is more strategic and with the addition of line clearance prediction, this should be improved. Additionally, the script needs to take into account the possibilities of combining the shapes in hand. For example, a 2x2 square and L shape can be combined into a 3x3 square

At this stage it will place a piece in the first available position on the board.
